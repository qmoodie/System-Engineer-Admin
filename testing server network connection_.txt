The error message you're encountering indicates that the connection to the specified URL is being refused. Here are some steps to diagnose and potentially fix the issue:Check if the Service is Running: Ensure that the service you are trying to connect to on qu32975-rh9.llan.ll.mit.edu is running and listening on port 8443. You can do this by running:sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8443If the service is not running, you need to start it.

Verify Firewall Settings: Ensure that the firewall on both your RHEL machine and the server at qu32975-rh9.llan.ll.mit.edu allows traffic on port 8443. You can check and modify the firewall settings using the following commands:# On your RHEL machine
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reloadRepeat the same on the server if you have access to it.Check SELinux: If SELinux is enabled, it might be blocking the connection. You can temporarily disable SELinux to check if it is the cause of the issue:sudo setenforce 0If the connection works after disabling SELinux, you may need to adjust the SELinux policies.Test Network Connectivity: Ensure that there are no network issues between your RHEL machine and the server. You can test this using ping and telnet:ping qu32975-rh9.llan.ll.mit.edu

# To test connectivity to port 8443
telnet qu32975-rh9.llan.ll.mit.edu 8443If ping fails, there might be a network issue. If telnet fails, the service might not be running, or the port might be blocked.Verify URL and Certificates: Ensure that the URL is correct and that you have the necessary certificates if SSL/TLS is used. If there are issues with certificates, you may need to update them or configure your client to trust the server’s certificate.Retry with Debug Mode: Run your command with verbose or debug mode to get more details:ansible-playbook -vvv your_playbook.ymlThis will provide more insight into where the connection is failing.

#CHECK STORAGE 
lsblk

Step 2: Create a New Partition
#Use parted to create a new partition. Replace /dev/sdx with the device identifier from the previous step (e.g., /dev/sda):
sudo parted /dev/sdx

Inside the parted tool, follow these sub-steps:

Print the existing partition table: print
Create a primary partition:
  mkpart primary xfs 1MiB 1001MiB
#Adjust 1MiB 1001MiB to the start and end points based on the available space. For example, if you have 1 GB free, you might use 1MiB 1001MiB.

Step 3: Format the New Partition
#Once the partition is created, format it with the XFS file system 
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdx1
#Replace /dev/sdx1 with the actual partition identifier.


Step 4: Create Mount Point
#Create a new directory where you will mount the new partition:
  sudo mkdir /mnt/newpartition
#Replace /mnt/newpartition with your desired path.


Step 5: Mount the Partition
#Mount the new partition to the directory you just created:
  sudo mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt/newpartition


Step 6: Ensure Permanent Mounting
#Open /etc/fstab in a text editor:
  sudo vi /etc/fstab
    /dev/sdx1 /mnt/newpartition xfs defaults 0 0
#Replace /dev/sdx1 and /mnt/newpartition with the correct partition identifier and mount point.

Step 7: Verify Everything Works
#Finally, verify that everything is set up correctly:
  df -h
